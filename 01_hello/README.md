# Hello World

This is an example of using the `cargo new --bin hello --vcs none` command that generates a hello-world program.

- **--bin** denotes that the package is going to be as a binary, not as a lib
- **--vsc none** skips `.git` and `.gitignore` when scaffolding the project

- `cargo run` builds and executes the code.
- `cargo clean` cleans up generated files.
